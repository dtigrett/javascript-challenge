# Javascript-Challenge

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 


For this challenge a basic HTML webpage generated an automatic table and date search for UFO sightings.    Using  a UFO dataset that was provided,
JavaScript code was written that appended a table to a web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

A  date form was utilized in the HTML document and used JavaScript code  that would listen for events and search through the `date/time` column 
to find rows that match user input.
