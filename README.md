# Javascript-Challenge

For this challenge a basic HTML page was created using  a UFO dataset that was provided in the form of an array
of JavaScript objects, code was written  that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

A  date form was used in the HTML document  JavaScript code was written that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column 
to find rows that match user input.
